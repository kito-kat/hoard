![althitonal.png](../../images/althitonal.png)  
a [cognitone](./cognitone.md) term for those who feel as though their mental state is deeply tied to and affected their alterhumanity / alterbeinghood, or as though their current state of mind is simply "[alterhuman](../../alterhuman/alterhuman.md)" and cannot be described aptly in another way.
