![cognitone.png](../../images/cognitone.png)  
a term to describe the current state someone's brain is in. As in describing how it is currently functioning. (ex: one might use the term "frogtonal" if they feel as though their thoughts are jumping from place to place or as though they are undergoing metamorphoses.)   
A cognitone can be anything and anyone can be cognitonal. This is a fluid identity that can be hoarded and constantly changing depending on how an individual wants to label themselves and what words they feel best describe their experiences.
