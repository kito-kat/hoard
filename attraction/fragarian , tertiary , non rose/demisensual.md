**Demisensual** is a sensual [orientation](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Orientation "Orientation") defined as someone who does not experience [sensual attraction](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Sensual_Attraction "Sensual Attraction") until they have formed a deep emotional connection with someone. The connection can be [platonic](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Platonic_Attraction "Platonic Attraction"), [romantic](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Romantic_Attraction "Romantic Attraction"), or some other form of connection. Forming an emotional bond with someone does not mean that one is automatically attracted to said person, as it just means there's now a possibility for one to feel [attraction](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Attraction "Attraction").
