![occuden.png](../../images/occuden.png)  
an identity based on an occupation / job-like role, fictional or real. examples include architects, scholars, scientists and marauders (c:aoa). this identity strongly influences the user & one's identification with the occupation may feel like a bigger part of one's identity than with the average experience someone with the occupation normally has. it is an alterhuman identity that isn't necessarily based in nonhumanity.
