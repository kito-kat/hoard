![vesil.png](../../images/vesil.png)  
An umbrella term for something that in some way affects many or all areas of someone's identity. Someone whose gender, orientation, alterhumanity, etc. is influenced or defined by outer space, for example, would be vesil.  
Someone may feel as though their vesility simply influences all or many aspects of their identity, it may define their identity, it may be their entire identity itself, alongside many other things. It may be literal, metaphorical, etc.. Vesility can be on a big scale between these experiences, and there is no wrong way to be vesil.
